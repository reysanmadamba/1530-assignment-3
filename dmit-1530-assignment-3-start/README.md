Developer Notes


Header & Footer

The header and footer are identical on both pages. 

The hamburger menu in the mobile view does not need to be functional.


Accordion Component

Upon loading the page, all items in the accordion component should be closed (collapsed). There is one open item in the Figma file for illustrative purposes (i.e. to see what an item should look like when open). 

The full text for the accordion component is available in the provided website-copy.md file. 


Form Validation States
 
Once the user has interacted with a form field (i.e. they have typed some sort of value and are no longer focused on it), check to see if their input is valid or invalid. This will require conditional selectors. ( see examples in figma file)

If their input is invalid, display an exclamation mark in the relevant field. 


The dropdown navigation in the small view “Does not need to work!”.

The first media query stop is at 980 pixels (the small view ends), then the page gracefully scale up to 1440 pixels and then is constrained in the viewport centre at larger widths.

The nav of the main page is sticky.

The “More New Arrivals You’ll Love” section contains a horizontal navigation component that contains twelve items.  Please duplicate the six provided.

The “Membership Sign Up” link in the modal window should open the “membership.html” page.

The Membership page displays sign up form

The “Back” link on the membership page should open the Index page and is in a fixed position in the viewport in the top left corner. 

Horizontal Scroll Component
There are six cards (images and descriptions) provided for the horizontal scroll component. Please duplicate them so that there are twelve in total, giving you enough content to overflow the container.

Miscellaneous Notes
All scrollbars and checkboxes are for illustrative purposes only. By default, their styles will change based upon the user’s operating system and browser. You do not need to add additional styles to these components. 

Modal Windows
Three seconds after the user loads the page, the modal window should automatically appear. It should be in a fixed position so that the user must interact with it before engaging with the rest of the page.
The ‘Sign Up Now’ link and the ‘offer details’ link should both take the user to the sign up page.

The ‘Close’ link or button in the upper right-hand corner should dismiss the modal window, letting the user interact with the page once more.
